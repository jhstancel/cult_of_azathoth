scenario:
  name: "The Living Maze"
  mode: "reach:heart"
  intro: |
    You awaken standing upright, not lying down.
    Stone walls press close on all sides, slick with moisture.
    The air smells wrong — old, metallic, expectant.
    Somewhere deep within the maze, something is waiting.

  starts:
    P1: "entry"
    P2: "mirror"

rooms:
  - id: "entry"
    name: "Maze Entry"
    description: |
      A narrow stone corridor stretches forward. The walls are damp and cold.
    detail_description: |
      Scratches mark the walls at shoulder height, as if something paced here.
      The floor slopes slightly downward, pulling you in.
    exits:
      forward: "fork"

  - id: "fork"
    name: "Forked Passage"
    description: |
      The corridor splits in three directions.
    detail_description: |
      The stone here is smoother, worn by countless turns and retraced steps.
      Each path feels equally wrong.
    exits:
      left: "echo"
      right: "sinkhole"
      forward: "loop"

  - id: "echo"
    name: "Echo Chamber"
    description: |
      A circular chamber where sound behaves strangely.
    detail_description: |
      Your breathing returns to you a second late.
      Footsteps echo even when you stand still.
    exits:
      back: "fork"
      whisper: "mirror"

  - id: "sinkhole"
    name: "Sunken Corridor"
    description: |
      The floor dips sharply, slick with moisture.
    detail_description: |
      Water drips steadily from the ceiling.
      The walls bulge inward, as if the maze is collapsing slowly.
    exits:
      back: "fork"
      down: "hollow"

  - id: "loop"
    name: "Endless Hall"
    description: |
      A long hallway stretches farther than it should.
    detail_description: |
      You are certain you have passed this crack in the wall before.
      Time feels slightly out of sync here.
    exits:
      back: "fork"
      forward: "loop"   # intentional loop
      side: "hollow"

  - id: "mirror"
    name: "Mirrored Vault"
    description: |
      Polished stone reflects your movement imperfectly.
    detail_description: |
      Your reflection lags half a second behind.
      Sometimes it moves when you do not.
    exits:
      out: "echo"
      fracture: "heart"

  - id: "hollow"
    name: "Hollow Crossing"
    description: |
      A wide junction carved out of the maze’s core.
    detail_description: |
      The stone here is warm to the touch.
      You feel watched, evaluated.
    exits:
      up: "sinkhole"
      side: "loop"
      inward: "heart"

  - id: "heart"
    name: "The Maze’s Heart"
    description: |
      The walls pulse faintly, like something breathing.
    detail_description: |
      Veins of dark stone throb with slow intent.
      The maze is aware of you now.
    exits:
      outward: "hollow"
