# Scenario Design Notes

## Theme & Mood
- Cosmic horror, creeping dread, slow realization.
- Player should feel watched and slightly out of place at all times.

## Key Locations
- Start: Moldy Cellar (safe but unsettling).
- Hallway: First hint of other presences and ritual activity.

## Important Items
- Rusty Key: First obvious tool for progress.
- Torn Page: Foreshadows the larger mystery / ritual.

## NPCs (future ideas)
- Hooded acolyte who never speaks, only gestures.
- Captive who knows too much but is on the edge of madness.

## Pacing Thoughts
- First 5–10 minutes: exploration and atmosphere.
- Then introduce a clear goal and a ticking clock if desired.
